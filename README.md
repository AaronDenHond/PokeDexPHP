PokeDex made in PHP

Learning objectives

    Starting with PHP
        To be able to write a simple condition and a simple loop
        (check)
        To know how to access external resources (API)
        (check)
        To know where to search for PHP documentation
        (check)
    To find out how much easier it is to learn a second programming language

UPDATE 27/5 : 
Broken PHPokedex fixed, but at the cost of functionality. Next evo doesnt show  but errors with searching 
by name and on page load have been fixed.

Plan of attack :

Check (for now...)
